
Introduction to Flutter:-
--------------------------
To develop a mobile application on Android (based on Java Language) and iOS (based on Objective-C/Swift Language) frameworks, we need two different codes, which is quite complex.
To overcome this complexity, there exists hybrid mobile application framework (uses HTML for UI and JavaScript for application logic), which provides a common code for both frameworks.

Flutter is such a simple and high performance framework, which is based on Dart language.

> Flutter is a hybrid mobile application framework which provides high performance by rendering the UI directly in the operating system's canvas rather than through native framework.

> It also offers many ready to use widgets to create modern application. Designing of these widgets is as simple as designing HTML.

> The Flutter application is itself a widget, where its widgets support animation and gestures. Its application logic is based on reactive programming.

Features of Flutter:-
==============
> Modern and reactive framework.

> Uses Dart programming language which is very easy to learn.

> Development is fastly done.

> Beautiful and fluid UIs.

> Widget Catalog is relatively huge.

> Runs same UI for multiple platforms.

> High performance application.

Advantages of Flutter:-
=================
> Flutter comes with beautiful and customizable widgets, fulfilling all custom needs and requirements of an outstanding mobile application.

> Dart language has a large repository of software packages, which lets you to extend the capabilities of your application.

> Developers need to write just a single code for both Android and iOS.

> Since it is a single code base, it requires lesser testing.

> Flutter's simplicity makes it a good candidate for fast development.

> It allows developers to have full control over the widgets and its layout.

> It offers great developer tools, including the amazing hot reload and hot restart.

Disadvantages of Flutter:-
===================
> Requirement of learning a new language called Dart (but is also easy to learn).

> In Flutter, UI and logic is intermixed, which can be overcomed by using coding/ high level module, in order to seperate UI and logic.

> Developers might have hard time in choosing a right development tool out of the pool, and Flutter happens to be just another framework to develop mobile applications.
